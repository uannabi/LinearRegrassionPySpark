## Evaluating Regression
  * Not just Linear Regression, but any model that attempts to predict continuous values (unlike categorical values, which is classification)
  * Some evaluation metrics like accuracy or recall.
  * These sort of metrics arenâ€™t useful for regression problems, we need metrics designed for continuous values!

## Some of the most common evaluation metrics for regression:
  * Mean Absolute Error 
    * This is the mean of the absolute value of errors.
    * Easy to understand, just average 
  * Mean Squared Error
    * This is the mean of the squared errors.
    * Larger errors are noted more than with MAE, making MSE more popular.
  * Root Mean Square Error
    * This is the root of the  mean of the squared errors.
    * Most popular (has same units as y)
  * R Squared Values
    * This is the root of the  mean of the squared errors.
    * Most popular (has same units as y)
